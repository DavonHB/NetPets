# Net Pets

A place to share your online animals

## Description

Net Pets is a place to get a virtual pet and interact with them and your friends.

We were inspired by websites and toys like Neopets and Tamagotchi to create a fun and interactive way to have an online pet.
After signing up you can choose your species, name your pet and perform certain activities. We included a way to obtain coins by completing tasks with your pet.
